This is my Task-6 HTML web app hosted on AWS EC2 using Apache.
I deployed a simple HTML web application for Task-6 on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance. I first launched the EC2 instance and connected to it using EC2 Instance Connect. Then, I installed Apache2 to serve web content and created my HTML files (index.html and optional additional pages) in the /var/www/html directory. After verifying that the website was publicly accessible via the EC2 public IP, I organized the source code in a separate project folder on the instance (~/aws-ec2-html-app). I initialized a Git repository in that folder, added and committed all HTML files, and then pushed them to my GitHub repository (https://github.com/huzef-1/task-6) using the HTTPS remote and my Personal Access Token (PAT). This workflow ensured that the web app is live on the internet and the source code is available publicly for submission. Screenshots of the live website and the EC2 instance console were also taken to complete the Task-6 deliverables.
